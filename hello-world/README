In the C'Dent world, you write *modules* in one language, and compile to many.

It is worthwhile to start with the simplest case. The problem with hello_world
is that it doesn't use any modules.

These examples all use a World module. The program instantiates a World object
from a World class, and calls the greet method, which prints the famous line.

In this scenario, the files called `hello_world.*` are all supposedly
ordinary program files written by Drones.

The `[Ww]orld.*` files are all modules. A Leet writes the module in one
language and (someday) uses C'Dent to compile it to the others. The Drones
rejoice, and the Acmeism moves forward.

== Glossary

- Acmeism - Acmeism is the belief that computer algorithms, frameworks
  and ideas are more important than the programming language they happen
  to be written in. An Acmeist has become enlightened to the truth that
  languages have become barriers that keep great programmers apart. The
  Acmeist is determined that the only great computer projects are the
  ones that benefit many programming languages.
- Acmeist - An Acmeist is a person who believes in the tenets of
  Acmeism. An Acmeist can be a programmer or not. A Drone can be an
  Acmeist; a hacker who believes in fighting against software segregation and
  who hopefully aspires to one day be a Leet. A Leet is absolutely an Acmeist.
- Drone - In Acmeism a Drone is a mortal programmer who just cares about
  doing the programming task at hand in their favorite language.
- Leet - A Leet is a supreme hacker being who believes in ideas over
  languages and wants those ideas available to drones of every language.
